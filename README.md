## Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}

## Development Environment

For this project currently my time was spent in python within Visual Studio Code. Using Google's Cloud Firebase store I was able to call the server and update information from the terminal.

## Useful Websites

* [FireBase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
* [FireStore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

## Future Work

* Ability to delete an item
* Ability to select which inventory section you wish to be in (Employee, Menu, etc.)
* Add more user interaction and a cleaner printing statement
* Add Javascript to make a web system that can handle the input from the browser rather than a terminal
