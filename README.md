# Cloud_Databases

## Overview

To use my program is as easy as just typing in an item and it will add it to the database. The purpose for doing this is to start my journey on working with cloud databases on ever more complex and intricate systems giving me a jumping platform to create and learn.

## Cloud Database

Firebase was used with "buckets" that contained various infomation types. The currently implemented *MENU* stores Strings and floats

## Development Environment

For this project currently my time was spent in python within Visual Studio Code. Using Google's Cloud Firebase store I was able to call the server and update information from the terminal.

## Useful Websites

* [FireBase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
* [FireStore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

## Future Work

* Ability to delete an item
* Ability to select which inventory section you wish to be in (Employee, Menu, etc.)
* Add more user interaction and a cleaner printing statement
* Add Javascript to make a web system that can handle the input from the browser rather than a terminal
